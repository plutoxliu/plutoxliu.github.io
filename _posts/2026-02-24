I will be submitting my PhD at the end of March, looking for new opportunities! <br>
My research expereiences are in: 
- genomics and genetics (from field collections to laboratory techniques to bioinformatic analysis), 
- physiological experiments (from study design to experimental setup tp statistical analysis), 
- spatial modelling (oceanographic models, species distribution models and GIS).
- Socioeconomic geography (quantitative and qualitative interviews and analysis)

I have special interests in marine ecosystem changes in polar regions (I enjoy the cold and being in the middle of nowhere!). <br>
I also advocate for gender-minorities (women and LGBTQ+) and ethnithity-minorities (non-European) in STEM, and multidisplinary research that combines science, arts and humanities.
Please contact me if you have or know of anything that might be related and in need of a new member!
